# Energy Neutral Device Demo

In this repository, KU Leuven presents a portable, energy-neutral device demonstrator. The demonstrator showcases the potential of ambient energy harvesting, with a particular emphasis on RF energy harvesting. Its primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a realistic use case, illustrating how low-power devices can operate without conventional power sources. This demonstrator includes an RF-powered Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) that operates entirely without batteries. Instead, the system relies on an aluminium electrolytic capacitor as a short-term energy storage element.
